# This is a simple example of a yaml based cpcli command

# To be recognised as a cpcli command a yaml file MUST contain:
# - 'longHelp'
# - 'shortHelp'

# If 'name' is not provided then the yaml file's name (less the '.yaml'
# extension) will be used instead.

# All other parameters are optional.

# The resulting cpcli comman *will* have direct access to the contents of
# this yaml file as a dictionary.
